# Ten Topics for Medical Informatics
The vast and heterogeneous data being constantly generated in the clinics can provide great wealth for patients and research alike. The quickly evolving field of Medical Informatics research contributed numerous concepts, algorithms, and standards to facilitate this development. 
There here addressed topics are part of our viewpoints and perspectives article "Ten topics to get started in Medical Informatics research", which is currently in peer-review.

This underlying summary and digital extension should provide likewise a condensed and extensible ressource for the identified important, initial ten topics and beyond. Contributors are welcome to comprehesively improve and extend the current state (See Contributors section).

In this the online ressource for content extension, all suggested topics are briefly introduced and then key words indicate topics and in-depths literature for further reading. In addition, the topics are set to cover current aspects and open research gaps of the Medical Informatics domain, including data regulations & concepts, data harmonization & processing, and data evaluation, visualization & dissemination.  

## Data regulations & concepts

### Topic 1: Privacy & Ethics
Health information is sensitive and hence needs to be highly protected and should not be generously shared. 
* Anonymization - [Meurers et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab068)
* Pseudonymization - [Zuo et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.2196/29871)

### Topic 2: Electronic health records & Clinical information systems 
Hospitals run clinical information systems (CIS) to collect, store, and alter clinical data about patients. A CIS, independent of the specialization and specific vendor, covers many clinical subdomains and integrates the patient-related data to support doctors in their daily routine.
The implementation of an EHR, including an individual's medical data in a bundled form, into the CIS is one key aspect. 
* EHR - [Häyrinen et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IJMEDINF.2007.09.001)
* Systematic terminolgies for EHR improvement - [Brender et al. 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1386-5056(00)00092-7), [Haux et al. 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1386-5056(02)00030-8), [De Hoop et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1055/S-0041-1739519), [Millar, 2016](https://doi.org/10.3233/978-1-61499-658-3-683)
* Improving the usability and user acceptance of EHRs - [Schaaf et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/S12911-021-01435-8)

### Topic 3: Data Provenance
When explainable data is processed with interoperable tools, scientists can create automated and reusable workflows, provide access to reproducible research outcomes, and  data analysis pipelines ([Palmblad et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTY646)). 
* Data provenance - [Palmblad et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTY646), [Xu et al. 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5961786/)

### Topic 4: Data Sharing
Cross-sectional medical data sharing is critical in modern clinical practice and medical research, in which the challenge of privacy-preserving transfer and utility needs to be addressed ([Scheibner et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.2196/25120)).

* Secure-multi-party computation (SPMC) - [Dong et al. 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378657/)

## Data harmonization & processing

### Topic 5: Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes 
Data handling in Medical Informatics remains a major challenge. Even though most data in medicine is available electronically, it often lacks interoperability ([Negro-Calduch et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IJMEDINF.2021.104507)). As a first step to actually use the data, processes to Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) are needed to obtain harmonized data from different data systems or clinical entities. 
* ETL, as safe, secure, and accurate - [Prasser et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IJMEDINF.2019.03.006), [Liaw et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/JAMIA/OCAA340)

### Disease Maps
Disease Maps are a community-driven systems medicine approach to represent and model disease mechanisms. Disease maps serve both as a knowledgebase and analytical tools for advanced Omics data integration and interpretation, as well as hypothesis generation. These maps can further serve as a basis for clinical decision support systems ([Mazein, A., Ostaszewski, M., Kuperstein, I. et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41540-018-0059-y)).
